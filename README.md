## Overview

This project explores 4th down decision-making in the NFL using public play-by-play data from the `nflfastR` dataset. The goal is to model and visualize how different yard lines, distances, and game contexts influence whether teams should go for it, punt, or kick a field goal.

## Features

- Logistic regression model predicting success probability of 4th down attempts
- Heatmap visualizations of success rates by field position and distance
- Strategic insight into coaching tendencies and conservative decision-making
- Clean, annotated Jupyter Notebook for reproducibility

## Technologies

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- sklearn (Logistic Regression)

## How to Use

1. Download or clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `nfl_4th_down_model.ipynb` in Jupyter
4. View plots and decision matrix to understand insights
